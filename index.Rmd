# Psychology is the hardest science

<div class="notes">
I claim that psychology is the hardest science.
</div>

## (Harder than physics)

<div class="notes">
Harder than physics.
I suspect most of the people in this room agree, but in case there are skeptics, let me try to convince you in two simple figures.
</div>

<!-- Yes, but if we change one element in this equation, the problem becomes immensely harder. What if we change the mass to a mouse? -->

<div class="notes">

Even asking the question seems humorous.

[RIGHT]

Let's examine why it's so hard.
</div>

# Why it's hard

<!-- My message today is that understanding why psychology and related sciences are so hard can be useful in making these allied fields better. -->

<div class="notes">
This figure depicts the classic Hindu myth of the blind men examining an elephant. 
To me, it also reflects the state of psychological science.

We're all studying the elephant, or so we say, but we might easily mistake the trunk for a spear, or the tail for a rope, and so forth.

I want to see the whole elephant!
Don't you?

<div class="notes">
This painting of the Tower of Babel should remind all of us often we're  like the builders after suffering God's wrath: Too often we struggle to communicate with one another about essential concepts and ideas from our distinct subfields.

For example, William James may have said that 'everyone knows what attention is', but I'm not sure we agree.

<img src="img/nested-causality-labels.png" height=600px/>

<!-- Perhaps less widely appreciated, the phenomena we study have a nested structure. -->

<div class="notes">
Relatedly, but perhaps less widely appreciated, the phenomena we study have a complex nested structure.

I designed this logo for my lab group to remind me of it.

The science of the mind and behavior collects and integrates evidence from at least four logically separable but mutually embedded realms.
</div>

---

- Body ($B$) within world ($W$)
- Nervous system ($N$) within body ($B$)
- Mind ($M$) within nervous system ($N$)

<div class="notes">

Our bodies are embedded in a world.
Our nervous systems with our bodies.
And our mind within the nervous system.
</div>

---

$\dot{M} = f(M,N)$

$\dot{N} = f(N,B)$

$\dot{B} = f(B,N,W)$

$\dot{W} = f(W,B)$

<div class="notes">
And using the mathematical language of dynamical systems, we can say that these realms are mutually coupled to one another: Changes in the mind are a function of mental and nervous system states, and so forth...

And make no mistake: The mind, brain, and body are non-linear dynamical systems, whether or not we study them that way.

Dynamical systems involve rule-based changes in state variables.
</div>

## Measure

<!-- The good news is that we have tools for measuring... -->

<div class="notes">
We have a growing box of tools for measuring many of them.
</div>

- $W$, $B$, $N$ more or less **directly**

<!-- States of the world, the body, and the nervous system more or less directly, across the multiple spatial and temporal scales of the relevant phenomena. -->

- Measure mental states $M$ **indirectly**
- Via $N$, $B$, $W$ (+ prior beliefs/knowledge)

<!-- But unfortunately, while often the star of the psychological show, we can only measure mental states indirectly via the nervous system, or changes in body state or behavior, and informed by prior beliefs and knowledge about those states. -->

<div class="notes">
But unfortunately, while often the star of the psychological show, we can only measure mental states indirectly via the nervous system, or changes in body state or behavior, and informed by prior beliefs and knowledge about those states.

I think these differences in measurement have consequences for inference we have yet to confront fully.

Beyond challenges in measurement, we may not appreciate the structure of the theoretical frameworks that dominate our scientific discourse.

I've recently become interested in some of the intellectual ancestors to cognitive science that we seem to have abandoned along the way: cybernetics and control theory are among them.

## *Closed-loop* causal chains better reflect the underlying reality

<!-- When in fact, closed-loop causal chains better reflect the underlying reality of the embedded and coupled systems we care about understanding. -->

<div class="notes">
But I also think that the underlying reality is more complex than this, and that non-linear, closed-loop, causal chains better reflect what cognitive science is really about.

el <- rbind(c("C","R"), c("R","W"), c("W","S"), c("S","C"))

g$layout <- igraph::layout_in_circle
plot(g, vertex.size=80, vertex.color="gray", edge.color = "blue")
```


<div class="notes">
The reality is that responses affect the world, responses and world states evoke stimuli, stimuli affects cognition, cognition affects responses, and the cycle repeats.

Non-linear, closed-loop dynamical systems like this require broader and denser data about all of the realms in order to reveal the underlying processes.
Data that can be difficult or expensive to collect.

But even in situations when the data are available, when all of these states are well-known, our current methods have some striking limitations.

A recent paper by Jonas and Kording illustrates this point.
These authors used conventional neuroscience techniques -- studying the connection pattern, observing the effects of damage on performance, responses of individual components to simulate 'recording' from a microprocessor that was engaged in the inputs and outputs of several well-known video games.
So, in effect, they already 'knew' the answers they were looking for.

<div class="notes">
The Turing machine as a universal computational device is the dominant framework in computer science, and most cognitive scientists think (explicitly or not) that the mind is some sort of computational device.

Central to this way of thinking is the goal of cognitive science is to reveal the algorithms or recipe for evaluating and transforming data.

We don't have to look very far to see how powerful and widespread algorithms have become in our day-to-day life.

- How to regulate the speed of a Watt-style steam engine?

<div class="notes">
And like most powerful and useful machines, it has to be controlled to be useful.
Beyond turning it on and off, the most important control is speed.
How to keep the speed constant?
</div>

---

```
1. Measure the speed of the flywheel.
2. Compare the actual speed against the desired speed.
3. If there is no discrepancy, return to step 1. Otherwise,
    a. measure the current steam pressure;
    b. calculate the desired alteration in steam pressure;
    c. calculate the necessary throttle valve adjustment.
4. Make the throttle valve adjustment.
5. Return to step 1. 
```

<div class="notes">
To a 21st century audience steeped in algorithmic thinking and surrounded by computational devices, the answer is obvious: Measure the speed, compare it to some desired value, if it differs, adjust the steam valve up or downward.

This is a negative feedback loop of the sort we're familiar with in various contexts, from thermostats to cruise control in our cars.

Note that the algorithm presumes that there are variables we can measure -- like speed, and calculations we can quickly and accurately.

25 W vs. ?? MW

<!-- Alpha Go vs. Ke Jie -->

<div class="notes">
This photo shows Google's AI system, AlphaGo in the midst of defeating the World Champion Go player.
Considering that Go was thought far too difficult a game for computers to master, it's indeed an achievement.

But the human player's brain was using about 25 W. 
I don't know that Google has revealed AlphaGo's power consumption in doing the same task, but it was probably in the megawatts.

So we're a long way from developing computational systems that are as energy efficient as brains.

<!-- Biological computing... -->

- Computes with chemistry (neurotransmitters, hormones) when possible
- With 'wires' (axons & dendrites) when necessary

One reason for this may be that biological computing seems to involve chemistry whenever possible, and wires only when necessary.

<div class="notes">
Indeed, we can rightly say that moving, sensing, computing, adapting are fundamental properties of life.

Now, I'm not suggesting that biological computing in single-celled organisms is identical to that of multicellular organisms or that these processes should be called 'cognition'.
But I am saying that we might gain some insight into human cognition by asking what parts of this elephant we're ignoring.
</div>

## Big data (-omics) approaches to other questions in biomedicine largely overlook *behavior*

<div class="notes">
For example, other areas of biomedicine have taken 'big data' approaches to revealing the structure at different levels of spatial and temporal resoulution.

Of course I refer to the genome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome projects.

Curiously, these approaches largely overlook one of the principal outputs of all of this machinery: *behavior*.

And that a better understanding of behavior is fundamental to achieving positive health outcomes, from prenatal development throughout adulthood.

I'd extend these claims to the principal task of understanding human cognition.

<div class="notes">
So psychology and allied fields are harder than physics for many reasons.

But there is an additional challenge that all sciences face: The challenge of producing reliable, robust, generalizable findings.

Richard Harris' book, Rigor Mortis, exposes some shocking problems with reproducibility in biomedical research, and I urge you to read it.
</div>

## Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

<div class="notes">
But let's start with a question: Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

Nature asked scientists across fields this question in 2016.

Let's focus on psychological science.
</div>

---

- Yes, a significant crisis
- Yes, a slight crisis
- No crisis
- Don't know

<div class="notes">
So, how many of you think there is a significant crisis in psychological science? A slight crisis? No crisis? Don't know.

The so-called 'hard' sciences.

I'm not sure, but I think psychology and the social sciences fall into 'other'.
See, we're not doing so badly!

One area where I think we could spend a bit more energy concerns the role of theory, and for this, I thank George Mischel for giving the problem a clever name: the toothbrush problem.

> "*...psychologists tend to treat other peoples’ theories like toothbrushes; no self-respecting individual wants to use anyone else’s.*"

<small>[Mischel, 2009](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science)</small>

---

> "*The toothbrush culture undermines the building of a genuinely cumulative science, encouraging more parallel play and solo game playing, rather than building on each other’s directly relevant best work.*"

<small>[Mischel, 2009](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science)</small>

<div class="notes">
Do we want to build a 'genuinely cumulative science'?

I do, and I think you do, too.

So what do we need to do?

# Making cognitive science even better

## Support research that

<div class="notes">
I suggest that sponsors like JSMF should support research that...
</div>

---

- studies *behavior(s)*
- not just (difficult-to-measure-directly) internal states

</small>

<div class="notes">
Bill Powers work on perceptual control theory seems to have left little mark on psychology, but this figure from his 1973 book I find instructive.

It shows how one might decompose a simple object tracking task into a series of perception/computation/action loops.

We could and should have rich descriptions of and theories about behaviors.
</div>

---

- samples densely (and/or broadly) in time & space
- creates meaningful linkages across levels of analysis

I also recommend that sponsors support research that samples densely or broadly in time & space and strives to achieve meaningful linkages across levels of analysis.

<div class="notes">
As this figure from Bronfenbrenner depicts, psychologists, especially those with training in development have long understood that a satisfying understanding of human behavior requires understanding influences within the individual and outside her.

In neuroscience, the tools of network theory have come to play important roles in inference.

And network theory is a tool that will help cognitive scientists characterize the networks of factors that influence human computation.

- "Responses" include behaviors
- AND autonomic/endocrine activity
- AND...

<div class="notes">
I also suggest that the range of behaviors or responses studied be broadened to include not only changes in or the active maintenance of body configurations but also heart rate, respiration, and other autonomic 'behaviors' and endocrine/hormonal activity.

<!-- Multiple loops for thermoregulation -->

<div class="notes">
Thermoregulation is a useful system for depicting negative feedback systems and multiple perceptual/action systems.

But it's likely that many other behavioral systems can be understood in similar terms.
Indeed, one insight from control theory and cybernetics is that if some variable is stable across time or space, it's subject to some form of control.
</div>

## Support research that

<div class="notes">
I suggest that we augment support for research that...
</div>

---

- attempts to close causal loops
- via specific algorithms and/or dynamical processes

---

- informed by rich theories of task performance (inputs, controlled variables, outputs)
- resists "premature simplification"

What's premature simplification?

<div class="notes">
These data (the Datasaurus dozen) are a version of Anscome's Quartet known to statistics for a long time. All of the distributions have the same means in X and Y, the same standard deviations, and the same correlations.
If we didn't visualize the data, and took as a given the simplification provided by the summary statistics, we'd miss important details.

Dimension reduction or simplification is essential in science, but only when it adds to our understanding and doesn't discard something essential.

The challenge is knowing when it's safe to simplify and when it's not.

This figure from Bill Powers again shows a later, more complex version of the same visual object tracking task.
Here the more complicated model explains more aspects of behavior.

I suggest that cognitive science can and should probably complicate before we simplify.

In our work with Ori Ossmy, we've shown that computer vision techniques can be 100 times faster than human coders and with similar levels of precision.

The human cost of video annotation is one of the biggest barriers to its widespread use, and so the potential to reduce these substantially is tremedously exciting.
